# Pick and Place

This repository contains the source code for the Studienarbeit `Robotino Pick and Place` by Lukas Marschar and Philipp Perez. The contained project is an application developed to control a Robotino robot.

This C++ project can be compiled using CMake. Therefore, the following dependencies are needed:
* Robotino API 2
* OpenCV 2.4.0

Compiling and running the application can be done by executing the following commands in a terminal:

1. Change the directory to this project: `cd pickandplace/`

2. `cmake .`

3. `make`

4. `target/pickandplace`



The application is made to run on an external computer and **not** on the Robotino itself.
