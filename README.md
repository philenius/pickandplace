# Pick and Place

This repository contains the source code for the Studienarbeit `Pick and Place` by Lukas Marschar and Philipp Perez 

This C++ project can be compiled using CMake. Therefore, the following dependencies are needed:
* Robotino API II
* OpenCV 2.4.0

Compiling and running the application is done by executing the following commands in a terminal:
1. Change the directory to this project: `cd pickandplace/`
2. `cmake .`
3. `make`
4. `target/pickandplace`



The application is made to run on an external computer and **not** on the Robotino itself.
